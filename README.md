# Rentals Agent - Australian Property Sales and Climate Data Integration

## Project Overview

This project aims to combine Australian property sales data across multiple cities with climate data to build an intelligent filtering and recommendation system based on regional climate preferences and property features.  
At this stage, the project focuses on offline historical data cleaning, preprocessing, and integration, laying the groundwork for future real-time data acquisition and advanced recommendation algorithms.

## Project Components

- **Property Sales Data:** Historical Australian property listings including price, bedrooms, bathrooms, address, and other key attributes.  
- **Climate Data:** Publicly available Australian weather data containing temperature, rainfall, wind, humidity, and other meteorological information.  
- **Data Processing:** Cleaning, handling missing values, and standardizing formats for both datasets.  
- **Data Matching:** Linking climate data and property data by city/location to enable climate-aware property filtering.  
- **Example Scripts:** Demonstration scripts implementing basic city-based filtering and price missing value handling.

## Current Progress

- Completed cleaning and preprocessing of Australian property sales data.  
- Cleaned and structured climate datasets.  
- Implemented filtering of properties by city and removal of listings with missing prices.  
- Provided example outputs demonstrating matched filtered properties.

## Future Plans

- Incorporate real-time property listing data acquisition and updates.  
- Expand filtering criteria to include multiple climate attributes and personalized user preferences.  
- Develop an interactive user interface for property search and visualization.  
- Explore deployment of the system on cloud platforms for scalable access.

## Environment Requirements

- Python 3.8+  
- Dependencies: pandas (and related libraries)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.  
2. Prepare Australian property sales and climate CSV datasets in designated directories.  
3. Run data cleaning scripts to preprocess the datasets.  
4. Execute filtering scripts to perform example property recommendations.
